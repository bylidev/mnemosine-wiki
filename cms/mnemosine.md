## The Most Powerful JMstack WIKI Made with Angular is Serverless and API-less! 💪

![](./images/caffee.gif)

## 🔥 **What is Serverless?** 🚀

Serverless is a cloud computing model where you don't manage servers. Instead, you pay only for specific functions that
execute in response to events.

### **Advantages of Serverless:**

- **Automatic Scalability**: Functions scale automatically based on demand.
- **Cost Efficiency**: You pay only for the execution time of your functions, not for idle servers.
- **Less Maintenance**: No need to worry about server infrastructure maintenance.

## 🌐 **What is API-less Architecture?** 🤔

API-less architecture focuses on building applications without directly interacting with APIs for every piece of
functionality. Instead, it may rely on static data or built-in functions and services. This can simplify development and
reduce dependencies on external systems.

### **Benefits of API-less Architecture:**

- **Simpler Development**: Fewer dependencies and reduced complexity.
- **Faster Execution**: Eliminates the need for API calls, which can speed up performance.
- **Reduced Costs**: Fewer external services may mean lower operational costs.

## 🎉 **How Do JAMstack and Serverless Relate?**

JAMstack and Serverless complement each other perfectly. While JAMstack focuses on a modern, fast frontend architecture,
Serverless handles backend logic seamlessly without the need for server management. Together, they provide a robust and
efficient solution for building web applications and sites.
